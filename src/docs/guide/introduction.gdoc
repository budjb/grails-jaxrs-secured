The *spring-security-jaxrs* plugin installs the necessary definition files into the Spring Security system to allow the
use of Jax-RS resources.  Annotations, interceptor URL mapping, and database request map modes are all supported.

The plugin requires no configuration to begin using, and follows the rules of the Grails Spring Security plugin as they
are configured in each application.
