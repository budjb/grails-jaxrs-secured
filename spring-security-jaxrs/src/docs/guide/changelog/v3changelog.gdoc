h3. Version 3.0.0
* Update plugin for Grails 3.x. (thanks to [Donald Jackson|https://github.com/donald-jackson]!)
* Update definition classes to match new Spring Security Core counterparts.
* Renamed project packages to @org.grails.plugins.spring.security.jaxrs@. This should not impact anyone unless\
  the classes contained in this package have been extended.
