h3. Version 3.0.1
* Fix security issue where resource paths defined with upper case letters do not properly match against\
  incoming requests. In practice, if Spring Security was configured to allow requests when no security rule\
  was found, security could be bypassed for paths with upper case letters.

h3. Version 3.0.0
* Update plugin for Grails 3.x. (thanks to [Donald Jackson|https://github.com/donald-jackson]!)
* Update definition classes to match new Spring Security Core counterparts.
* Renamed project packages to @org.grails.plugins.spring.security.jaxrs@. This should not impact anyone unless\
  the classes contained in this package have been extended.
